# Project Description
 Utilized VBA scripting to analyze real stock market data. 


 Created a script that loops through all the stocks for one year and outputs the following information: 

- Ticker Symbol

- Yearly change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at    the   end of that year

- The percent change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year

- The total stock volume of the stock.  

- Conditional formatting highlights positive change in green and negative change in red.
